Kth Permutation Sequence

The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,

We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3 ) :
1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

For example, given n = 3, k = 4, ans = "231"
Good questions to ask the interviewer :

What if n is greater than 10. How should multiple digit numbers be represented in string?
In this case, just concatenate the number to the answer.
 so if n = 11, k = 1, ans = "1234567891011"

Whats the maximum value of n and k?
In this case, k will be a positive integer thats less than INT_MAX.
n is reasonable enough to make sure the answer does not bloat up a lot.

    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) 
        nums[i] = i+1;
   
    vector<int>fact(n,  INT_MAX);
    fact[0] = 1;
    
    for(int i = 1; i<min(n,12); i++) 
        fact[i] = i*fact[i-1];
   
    string ans;
    k--;
    
    while(n--){
        int idx = k/fact[n];
        k %= fact[n];
        
        ans += to_string(nums[idx]);
        nums.erase(begin(nums)+idx);
    }
   
    return ans;
